Objective: 
The objective is to design and develop small working prototype of centralized newsfeed 
system.

Description: 
Designing a simple newsfeed management system. The system should take simple 
text file containing news sites such as follows:
• http://in.finance.yahoo.com
• https://www.reuters.com/places/india
• https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/

The goal is to extract individual news by security and store these feeds as JSON files by date. 
The JSON file should contain fields such as current_date, story_date, story_time, body, title, 
source, story_id, … For securities we have the pickle file containing security and 
company name that we can traverse. 
Some fields are described here:
security - security
current_date - process date
author - article author
story_date - extract story date from article
story_time - extract story time from article
body - story text (cleaned text)
title - story title
source - newspaper (abbreviations to newspaper)
category - news | rss | …
topics - topics from document
Features: 
1. Potential parallelism to fetch feeds in parallel
2. Checking duplicity of feed by combination of (title, story_date, …)
3. Storing news feed into one of the document database (Redis, MongoDB, RethinkDB, etc…)
4. How many articles per day has been received from a source
5. Using Python | Flask developed REST on top of the results via simple flask server which allows basic queries such as
A. How many articles captured by source on a date ?
B. How many articles by source over date | time period ?
